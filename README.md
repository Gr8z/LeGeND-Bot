## FAQ

### Why does it say "Cannot reach Clash Royale servers?"

Make sure you have set your Official Clash Royale API Token from https://developer.clashroyale.com using the [p]settokencr.

### Why are some cogs not loading?

Many cogs depend on additional python libraries, and also other cogs. If you want to install a clash royale cog, make sure you have crtools installed first.

### Why are my cogs getting unloaded after restart?

Some of your clash royale cogs might get disabled on restart because it requires crtools to be loaded first. To fix this:

* Go to your bot's root folder and open `red.py`
* look for ``bot.load_extension('cogs.owner')``
* Then add this line after: ``bot.load_extension('cogs.crtools')``
